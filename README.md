# MERN Zustand Auth - Authentication and Authorization with JSON Web Tokens

This is a simple user authentication application using email and password. In which you can only access the url of the profile if you previously authenticate through a login.

The frontend is developed with React, TypeScript and zustand as global state handler and data persistence as the token. In the backend we use the jsonwebtokens library to validate a user who logs in.

## ðŸ’» Quick start

### Backend

To deploy this project, you must first install the node_modules packages. To do this, open a console with the path of the project's server folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file in the project's server directory with the following environment variables:

    PORT=<Port>

Finally, in this terminal run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

As in the backend you need to load the node_modules from the client folder through the `npm install` command, finally run also `npm run dev` to launch the client application.
